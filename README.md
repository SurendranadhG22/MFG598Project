# MFG598Project
The UAV Landing project is a sophisticated ROS simulation for guiding UAVs to land on both stationary and moving targets using dynamic control strategies. It integrates the hector_quadrotor model and hector_gazebo for lifelike simulations, featuring advanced velocity estimation and PID tuning, supported by Python and visualized through RViz.
